**Title:**
Approach the impact of the minimum wage of the minimum wage ont the employment in Florida by using machine learning.

**Abstract:**
For decades, the impact of the minimum wage on employment
has been a recurring topic. This research uses machine learning
approaches to look at this topic from a different angle. To date, several
studies have been conducted that used traditional economic models.
Within this research, employment is predicted using three algorithms:
Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest (FR), and Extreme Gradient
Boosting (XGBoost). Data from the construction industry in Florida
from 2010 to 2022 is used. The evaluation metrics precision, recall,
accuracy, and weighted F1-score are used. The results show that the
RF is the best performance model with a weighted F1-score of 0.91
on the test data. RF outperforms the baseline and can better handle
the class imbalance problem. The best performance model, RF, has
been tested in other industries, such as elementary and secondary
schools. Although the best performance model in this industry does
not outperform the baseline, it is demonstrable that the weighted F1
score is significantly high.
