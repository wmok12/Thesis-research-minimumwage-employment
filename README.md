**Title:**
Approach the impact of the minimum wage of the minimum wage ont the employment in Florida by using machine learning.

**Abstract:**
For decades, the impact of the minimum wage on employment
has been a recurring topic. This research used machine learning
approaches to examine this topic from a different angle. To date, sev-
eral studies have been conducted using traditional economic models.
Within this research, employment is predicted using three machine
learning algorithms: Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest (FR),
and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). LR will be served as a
baseline. Data from the construction industry in Florida from 2010 to
2022 is used. The evaluation metrics Precision, Recal, Accuracy, and
weighted F1-score are used to evaluate the performance. The results
show that the RF is the best performance model with a weighted
F1-score of 0.91 on the test data. RF outperforms the baseline and
can better handle the class imbalance problem than the LR algorithm.
The best performance model, RF, has been tested in another industry,
such as elementary and secondary schools. Although the best perfor-
mance model in this industry does not outperform the baseline, it is
demonstrable that the weighted F1-score is significantly high.
